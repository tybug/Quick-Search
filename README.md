# Quick-Search

A google chrome plugin that utilizes the omnibox to cut out the results page middleman.

I occasionally find myself googling something where I know exactly what the first result will be (and I know I want to navigate to that very page). This can happen often with wikipedia articles, for instance. This plugin lets you tell chrome that you want to automatically click on the first search result.


## Usage

* Go to chrome://extensions and enable developer mode
* Install the extension by downloading this repo and selecting "load unpacked" on the extension page
* select the omnibox (colloquially known as the search bar, at the top of your browser)
* Type "g" and then hit tab. You are now searching via this extension
* Type your search normally and hit enter. You will be taken to the first webpage, identical to searching and clicking on the first result
