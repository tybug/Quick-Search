# Quick-Search
A google chrome plugin that utilizes the omnibox to cut out the results page middleman

# Motivation
Have you ever gone to google something, known exactly what you wanted and exactly what the google results were going to give you, and wasted 1 to 2 seconds of your precious time clicking the first google result?
If that sounds like something you would think, as I did, then this extension is for you.

# Usage
* Install the extension, either 
    * from the chrome store
    * download this repo and pack it yourself
* select the omnibox (colloquially known as the search bar, at the top of your browser)
* Type "g" and then hit tab. You are now searching via this extension
* Type your search normally and hit enter. You will be taken to the first webpage - identical to google searching and clicking the first result.
